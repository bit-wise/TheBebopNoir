The Bebop Noir

The sea was restless. The lighthouse flickered, erratically, then stopped, with a sudden pop.

I leaned back in my chair, the creaking sound blending with the distant murmur of the sea. The office was dim, lit only by the faint glow of a desk lamp, casting long shadows across the room. I flicked a glance at the clock – it was nearing midnight. That's when she walked in.

She was the kind of woman who could make a bishop kick in a stained-glass window – tall, with curves in all the right places, and eyes that sparkled like the ocean under moonlight. She paused at the doorway, her silhouette framed against the faint light from the hall.

"Mr. Marlowe, I presume?" Her voice was smooth, like velvet, but carried an edge of urgency.

"That's what it says on the door," I replied, motioning her to the chair across from my desk. "What can I do for you, Miss...?"

"Thompson. Clara Thompson." She sat down, crossing her legs. "I need your help."

I leaned forward, intrigued despite myself. "I'm listening."

She hesitated, biting her lip. "It's about my husband. He's missing. Disappeared a week ago. The police aren't taking it seriously, but I know something's wrong."

I nodded slowly. "Tell me everything."

As she spoke, I couldn't help but notice the way her hands trembled, the fear in her eyes. She was scared, genuinely scared. Something about her story didn't add up, but I couldn't put my finger on it yet.

After she left, I sat alone in the dark, mulling over her words. There was a puzzle here, a mystery that was itching to be solved. And I had a hunch that this was just the tip of the iceberg.

I poured myself a drink, the amber liquid reflecting the dim light. The night was still young, and so was this case. I had a feeling it was going to be a long one.

With a sigh, I grabbed my coat and hat. The streets of the city were calling, and I was ready to dive into the shadows to find the truth, whatever it might be.

"Time to hit the pavement," I murmured to myself, stepping out into the cool night air. The adventure was just beginning.
